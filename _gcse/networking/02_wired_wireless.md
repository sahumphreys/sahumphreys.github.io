For homes and small businesses there is the choice between connecting to the local network using cables, or via radio waves wirelessly.  It was not so long ago that the only option was to use cable but that situation is rapidly changing and, certainly domestically, wireless is becoming more prevalent. Both technologies have their advantages and disadvantages and here the two are compared.

## Wired LAN
 
The wired LAN uses physical cables to connect devices within a network.  The predominant cable type today is Ethernet cable, typically having four pairs of twisted copper wires enclosed in a plastic sheath, known as a twisted-pair cable. The twisting of the pairs helps reduce electromagnetic interference.  The cable may be **unshielded** or **shielded**.  The shielded cable has additional protection against interference. 

The ends of Ethernet cables have connectors called RJ45 connectors, which resemble larger versions of telephone line connectors (RJ11). These connectors have eight pins that correspond to the eight wires inside the cable.

Ethernet cables come in different categories such as Cat5, Cat6, Cat7, and Cat8. Each category has specific specifications for data transfer speed, bandwidth, and potential interference reduction. For instance, Cat6 cables generally support higher data transfer rates compared to Cat5 cables.

Connecting devices using Ethernet cable is well established and very reliable, unless the cable itself develops a fault.  However, you do need a lot of cable as each device needs to be connected, usually via a central hub or switch.  It can be time-consuming, and costly to run cables through walls.

On average, a wired connection will be more reliable tha a wireless connection and offer higher bandwidth for devices on the network - it's faster with Cat6a cable delivering 10 Gbps throughput - though Wireless is improving all the time.

## Wireless LAN

A wireless network uses radio waves to transmit data between devices, intended to replace wired connections.  WiFi is a type of wireless networking that uses radio frequencies to send and receive data. WiFi allows users to connect to the Internet at high speeds without the necessity of cables. WiFi stands for “wireless fidelity” and is a phrase that is often used to refer to wireless networking technologies. A wireless router is used to connect to the internet. When you connect to Wi-Fi, you’re connecting to a wireless router that connects your Wi-Fi-enabled devices to the Internet.

Wireless can be used for a PAN using Bluetooth that communicates across short distances, usually no more than a few metres typically connecting desktops, laptops, smartphones, speakers etc..  Bluetooth was intended for portable devices and their applications.

Wifi and Bluetooth are complementary, Wifi requires an access point which has responsibility for routing all traffic while Bluetooth connects two devices together with minimal configuration.
