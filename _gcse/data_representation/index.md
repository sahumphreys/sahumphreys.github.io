This is a big unit with many sections but reduces to the fact that computers are digital machines and all the data they process have to be converted from their original form, characters, sound, images etc., into a digital representation i.e. **binary**.  It's fundamental to our understanding of how computers work.

You will need to understand how and why numbers can be represented in different bases, including base 10 (decimal), base 2 (binary) and base 16 (hexadecimal)

You must be able to:

- understand how binary and hexadecimal can be used to represent whole numbers and be able to convert numbers between these bases in all directions
- add binary integers and know how to multiply binary numbers by applying shift operations

You must know that:

- the bit is the fundamental unit of information
- a byte is a group of 8 bits.
- multiple of bytes have their own terms e.g. kilobyte, megabyte etc..

You need to know and understand how computer systems represent:

- integers
- characters
- graphics
- sound

You must also understand:

- how and why data can be compressed

There is a lot of theory but grasping these fundamentals is important as it connects to all other topics in the specification.
