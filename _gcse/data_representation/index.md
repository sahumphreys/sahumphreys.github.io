This is a big unit with many sections but reduces to the fact that computers are digital machines and all the data they process have to be converted from their original form, characters, sound, images etc., into a digital representation i.e. **binary**.  It's fundamental to our understanding of how computers work.

This section covers the following topics:

### Number bases


- Understand the following number bases:
    - decimal (base 10)
    - binary (base 2)
    - hexadecimal (base 16).
- Understand that computers use binary to represent all data and instructions.
- Explain why hexadecimal is often used in computer science.

### Converting between number bases

- Understand how binary can be used to represent whole numbers.
- Understand how hexadecimal can be used to represent whole numbers.
- Be able to convert in both directions between:
    - binary and decimal
    - binary and hexadecimal
    - decimal and hexadecimal.

### Units of Information

- Know that:
    - a bit is the fundamental unit of information
    - a byte is a group of 8 bits.
- Know that quantities of bytes can be described using prefixes.
- Know the names, symbols and corresponding values for the decimal prefixes:
    - kilo, 1 kB is 1,000 bytes
    - mega, 1 MB is 1,000 kilobytes
    - giga, 1 GB is 1,000 Megabytes
    - tera, 1 TB is 1,000 Gigabytes.
- Be able to compare quantities of bytes using the prefixes above.

### Binary Arithmetic

- Be able to add together up to three binary numbers.
- Be able to apply a binary shift to a binary number
- Describe situations where binary shifts can be used.
