This module provides a straightforward exploration of the foundational concepts in computing. We'll begin by defining key terms such as **hardware**, **software**, and **computer systems**. From there, we'll delve into **system software** and **application software**, understanding the roles of **operating system**s and **utility software**.

Moving on to **programming languages**, we'll clarify what they are and differentiate between **low-level** and **high-level** languages. The discussion will touch upon **machine code** and **assembly language** as low-level languages, and we'll explore the functions of programming translators like **assemblers**, **compilers**, and **interpreters**.

The module also covers the hardware components found inside a computer system, including the **motherboard**, **CPU**, **graphics card**, and others. We'll then focus on the CPU's role, breaking down its main functions and understanding performance factors such as **clock speed**, **processor cores**, and **cache size**, along with the **Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**.

**Memory** will be examined, distinguishing between **volatile** and **non-volatile** memory, explaining the purpose of **RAM**, and discussing its impact on a computer's performance. We'll also cover **virtual memory** and **cache memory**.

Lastly, the module concludes with an exploration of **secondary storage**, covering types such as **optical**, **magnetic**, and **solid-state storage**. We'll analyze the characteristics and applications of each type, considering factors like capacity, speed, portability, durability, reliability, and cost, to make informed recommendations for specific applications.
