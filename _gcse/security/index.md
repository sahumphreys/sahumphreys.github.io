As our devices connect to a network we open the possibility of intrusion and bad actors being able to access those networks.  There are a variety of threats and in this section we will look at these threats and the measures that can taken to counteract against them.  We are evermore reliant on these interconnected systems for business, pleasure, shopping etc and there is responsibility on both ourselves as users of these systems and the organisations providing these services to ensure our data is safe.

There are two related fields:

- Network Security
- Cyber Security

**Network Security** encompasses a variety of strategies, technologies, and practices, ranging from firewalls to encryption algorithms with the explicit focus on safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources within a network. It deals with securing the communication and infrastructure components of a network.

**Cyber Security** has a broader scope and involves protecting all aspects of information systems, including networks, computer systems, software, data, and applications. It addresses threats from various sources, such as malware, unauthorized access, social engineering, and more.

In an era dominated by digitization and global connectivity, cyber threats have become more sophisticated and pervasive including malware, phishing attacks that seek to exploit vulnerabilities in the digital landscape.

Keep in mind that the field of Network Security and Cyber Security is dynamic, yet the challenges and solutions discussed here provide a foundational understanding. Our journey is not merely a snapshot but a continuous exploration into the evolving strategies and technologies that ensure the resilience of digital infrastructures.

In particular we will look at:

- **Threats to computer systems and networks**: including malware, social engineering, e.g. phishing, brute-force attacks, denial of service, attacks, data interception and theft and the concept of SQL injection
- **Prevention strategies**: including penetration testing, anti-malware software, firewalls, user access levels, MAC Address filtering, biometrics, passwords, encryption and physical security
