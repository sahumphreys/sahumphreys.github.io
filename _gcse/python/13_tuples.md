Similar to a list, a tuple is a sequence of values which can be of any type and are indexed by integers.  The key difference however is that a tuple is **immutable** meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.  Tuples are typically used to group related data together.

## Creating Tuples
You can create a tuple by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within parentheses `()`.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")
```

Alternatively a tuple can be created by calling the function `tuple()`:

```py
empty_tuple = tuple()           # -> an empty tuple
my_tuple = tuple("apple")       # -> ('a','p','p','l','e')
```

The `tuple()` function takes only one argument, so best to think of it as converting another type into a tuple type.  As in the example above that takes the string "apple" and returns a tuple with teh elements of that string.  Similarly, if we give `tuple()` a list:

```py
my_tuple = tuple([1,2,3])
print(my_tuple)             # -> (1,2,3)
```

## Accessing Elements
Elements in a tuple are accessed using indexing, just like in lists. Python uses 0-based indexing.

```python
first_element = my_tuple[0]  # Access the first element
```

The slicing operator will also work on tuples:

```py
my_tuple = ('a','p','p','l','e')
print(my_tuple[1:4])                # -> ('p','p','l')
```

But, if you try to modify any element in a tuple you will get an error:

```py
my_tuple = ('a','p','p','l','e')
my_tuple[0] = 'A'                   # -> TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

## Use Cases
Tuples are useful when you have a collection of related data that should not change. For example, coordinates (x, y), date and time (year, month, day, hour, minute), and more.

## Comparing tuples

Relational operators can be applied to tuples.  They start by comparing the first element of each tuple and then move to the second and so on:

```py
>>> (3, 7, 9) < (3, 6, 8)
False
>>> (2, 8, 100) < (20, 8, 200)
True
```

## Tuple assignment

There is a unique Python feature that can be used as a tuple can be on the left of an assignment statement.  Easier to show in an example:

```py
>>> a = ['Hello', 'World']
>>> b,c = a                     # clearer if we used brackets i.e. (b, c) = a
>>> b
'Hello'
>>> c
'World'
```

A neat use of this feature is to swap the values of two variables:

```py
>>> b, c = c, b
>>> b
'World'
>>> c
'Hello'
```

We can go further and use it, for example to split an email address into the username and domain:

```py
>>> email = 'peter.davies@gmail.com'
>>> username, domain = email.split('@')
>>> username
'peter.davies'
>>> domain
'gmail.com'
```

## Dictionaries and tuples

Recall the example for the section on dictionaries:

```py
for n in student.items():
    print(n)            
```

The output is:

```py
('name', 'John')
('age', 25)
('grade', 'A')
```

If we call the `items()` function on our dictionary, it returns a list of tuples as `dict_items()`.  Each item in the list is a tuple with key value pairs.:

```py
>>> student = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "grade": "A"}
>>> student.items()
dict_items([('name', 'John'), ('age', 25), ('grade', 'A')])
```

It helps to first convert the in-built `dict_items()` form to a list:

```py
>>> s = list(student.items())
>>> s
[('name', 'John'), ('age', 25), ('grade', 'A')]
```

As this is now a list of tuples, they can be sorted.

Similarly, we saw the following used when looking at dictionaries:

```py
# Iterating through key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, value)
```

The `key` and `value` here is a tuple (without the brackets, as brackets are optional).

## Tuples as return values

Another neat feature of the Python tuple is when we might want to return more than oone value from a function.  Consider the following example:

```py
def get_name_and_age():
    name = "Alice"
    age = 25
    return name, age

result = get_name_and_age()
print(result)  # Output: ('Alice', 25)
```

The function `get_name_and_age()` returns a tuple containing two values: the `name` and `age`. The caller of the function can then unpack the tuple into separate variables or use it as-is:

```py
name, age = get_name_and_age()
print(name)  # Output: 'Alice'
print(age)   # Output: 25
```
