Consider we need a program that processes capital cities of the world, we could store the names of these cities:

```py
capital1 = "London"
capital2 = "New York"
capital3 = "Paris"
capital4 = "Canberra"
# etc ...
```

Of course, the problem here is the `# etc...`.  For each new city we need a new variable.

Lists provide the solution, we can gather together the collection of cities under the one name:

```py
capital_cities = ["London", "New York", "Paris", "Canberra"]
```

The list is a fundamental data structure in Python that allows us to store and manage such collections of data. The `capital_cities` list contains a list of strings, but the list can contain any type of data.  Their contents can be changed during the run of the program, items can be added, changed or removed i.e. they are **mutable** 

## Creating Lists

To create a list we give it a name followed by the assignment operator and then a comma-separated sequence of items within square brackets `[]`.

```python
empty_list =[]                              # an empty list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14]
nested = [1,2,3, ['a','b'], 90]             # a nested list
```

{: .callout.notice}
> `my_list` has items of mixed data types, this is allowed, it can also contains lists as in `nested`.  The nested list here, `['a','b']` still counts as one item in this list, the number of elements in `nested` is 5.


## Accessing Elements

Individual elements of the list can be accessed by using **indexing.** Python uses 0-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0.

```python
first_element = my_list[0]  # Access the first element
```

To retrieve "Paris" from the list of cities we would use:

```py
this_city = capital_cities[2]
```

{: .callout.warning}
> Make sure you understand why the index used here is 2 and not 3

![](/assets/img/arrays.png)

Thinks of this processing as mapping where each index "maps" to an item in the list.  Any integer expression can be used as the index e.g.

```py
count = 3
print(fruits[count])
print(fruits[count+1])
```
The index can also be negative, in which case it starts to count from the end of the list.


## Iterating over a list

The easiest way to iterate over the list (visit every item) is to use a `for` loop:

```py
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)        # => "apple", "banana", "cherry"
```

This is fine when we need to do something with *every* item in the list.  If we want to modify particular items then we have to use the index for that item, usually combined with a function such as `range()` or `len()`:

```py
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    fruits[i] = fruits[i].upper()
```

Remember, `len()` returns the number of items in the list, and `range()` handles the indices from $0$ to $n-1$ (where $n$ is the number of items in the list).

## Modifying Lists

* Lists are ''mutable'', so you can change their content by assigning new values to elements.
* This can be done by using the index:

```python
# Modifying list elements using the index
fruits[0] = "orange"
```
* Or by using a list operation:

```py
numbers.append(6)     # Adds 6 to the end of the list
numbers.insert(2, 99)  # Inserts 99 at index 2
numbers.remove(4)     # Removes the element with value 4
```

## List Slicing:

* You can extract a portion of a list using slicing, which involves specifying a start and end index, separated by the slice operator, a colon `:`:

```python
# Slicing a list
sublist = numbers[1:4]  # Extracts elements at indices 1, 2, and 3
partial = fruits[:2]    # Extracts elements at indices 0 and 1
```

{: .callout.notice}
> The same slicing approach can be used when extracting sections of a string as a sub-string

* If the first index in the slice is omitted, the slice starts at the beginning of the list; if the second is omitted it will go through to the end of the list. (Omitting both returns the whole list.)

## List Operations

There are a number of useful operations, we can perform on the list, including appending, extending, and removing elements.

```python
my_list.append(4)        # Add an element to the end
my_list.extend([5, 6])   # Extend the list with another list
my_list.remove("apple")  # Remove a specific element
my_list.clear()          # remove all elements from the list
my_list.sort()           # sort the list
my_list.pop()            # removes the element at the back of the list
```

Most of these list operations act on the list but return `None`, e.g. it looks like `b` will be assigned the sorted list `a` but it does not:

```py
a = [9,3, 0, 2]
a.sort()            # OK, a is now [0,2,3,9]
a = [9,3, 0, 2]
b = a.sort()        # b is None
```

Lists can be joined together, concatenated, using the `+` operator:

```py
listA = [1,2,3]
listB = [4,5,6]
listC = listA + listB           # => [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

{: .callout.notice}
> Similarly the mulitplication operator, `*`, can be used to repeat the list a number of times in a new list

### List Functions

Also, Python provides built-in functions for working with lists, such as `len()`, `max()`, and `min()`.

```python
length = len(my_list)    # Get the length of the list
max_value = max(my_list)  # Find the maximum value in the list
min_value = min(my_list)  # Find the minimum value in the list
sum_of_list = sum(my_list)  # sums the values in the list (only works with numbers)
```

## Checking for List Membership:

* You can check if an item is present in a list using the `in` keyword.

```python
# Checking for list membership
if "apple" in fruits:
    print("Found apple in the list")
```

* To get the position of an item in a list we use the `index()` method:

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits.index("cherry"))                   # prints 2
```

## Lists and strings

A string is a sequence of characters and often behaves like a list but note the following code:

```py
str = "hello"
str_list = list(str)
print(str_list)         # ['h','e','l','l','o']
```

The `list()` function breaks the string into its individual characters.

## Lists are objects

This section can be omitted and returned to after we've looked into **objects** in more detail.

Consider the following example:

```py
a = "hello"
b = "hello"
```

Both variables refer to a string, but are they the same string (i.e. are those characters `hello` stored in the same location in memory)?

We can test this using the `is` operator, using the interactive environment:

```py
>>> a = "hello"
>>> b = "hello"
>>> a is b
True
```

So Python has created one string object, and the variables `a` and `b` are pointing to that same object.  Python has not allocated two separate memory locations for the value of these variables.

Try the same approach with two lists:

```py
>>> a = ['h','e','l','l','o']
>>> b = ['h','e','l','l','o']
>>> a is b
False
```

Now we get two distinct objects with their own allocated memory, they are not the same object.

The following should not be surprising therefore:

```py
>>> a = ['h','e','l','l','o']
>>> b = a
>>> a is b
True
```

Also:

```py
>>> a = ['h','e','l','l','o']
>>> b = a
>>> a is b
True
>>> b[0] = 'X'                  # modify an element in b
>>> b
['X', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
>>> a                           # it's also modified in a
['X', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

This is known as aliasing - and is best avoided!  But both `a` and `b` are named identifiers for an address in computer memory, in this case (as with the string example above) they have the same memory address.

## Summary

* Lists are ordered, meaning they maintain the order in which items were added.
* Lists can contain elements of different types.
* Lists are versatile and can be used to implement various data structures like stacks and queues.
* Lists can be nested, meaning you can have lists within lists.


## Example

```python
# Creating a list of numbers
my_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Accessing and modifying list elements
my_numbers[2] = 35
my_numbers.append(60)

# Slicing the list
subset = my_numbers[1:4]  # [20, 35, 40]

# Using list comprehension to create a new list
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in my_numbers]

# Checking for list membership
if 25 in my_numbers:
    print("25 is in the list")

# Displaying the modified list and squared numbers
print(my_numbers)
print(squared_numbers)
```
