An **algorithm** is:

> a set of mathematical instructions or rules that, especially if given to a computer, will help to calculate an answer to a problem

That is, a step-by-step procedure or a set of well-defined instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. 

Algorithms can be found in various fields, not just in computing. They are commonly used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other disciplines to define processes for solving problems. In the context of computer science, algorithms are crucial for programming and are often implemented in software to automate tasks or computations.

Key characteristics of algorithms include:

1. **Input:** Algorithms take some input(s), which are the data or values they operate on.
2. **Output:** Algorithms produce output(s), which represent the result or solution to the problem.
3. **Definiteness:** Each step in the algorithm must be precisely and unambiguously defined.
4. **Finiteness:** The algorithm must stop after a number of steps.
5. **Effectiveness:** Each step must be simple and executable in a given amount of time.

Algorithms are fundamental to the field of computer science and are used in various applications, such as sorting data, searching for information, optimizing processes, and more. They serve as the foundation for developing efficient and effective software solutions.

In this section we look at how we can create, interpret, complete and refine algorithms as well as how the algorithm can be expressed without using a programming language.  Both pseudocode and flowcharts will be used when considering algorithms used to accomplish searching and sorting.


 <!-- The principles of computational thinking are foundational concepts that help individuals approach and solve problems in a way that a computer could execute. These principles are essential in computer science and can be applied to a wide range of problems. Here's an explanation of each: -->

<!-- Abstraction: -->

<!-- Definition: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential details while ignoring unnecessary information. -->
<!-- In Practice: In programming and problem-solving, abstraction means breaking down a problem into its key components and representing them in a way that hides unnecessary details. For example, when writing code, you might create functions or classes that encapsulate specific tasks, allowing you to work with higher-level concepts without getting bogged down in the intricacies of every detail. -->
<!-- Decomposition: -->

<!-- Definition: Decomposition is the process of breaking down a problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts. -->
<!-- In Practice: When faced with a complex problem, decomposing it helps in tackling smaller sub-problems individually. This makes it easier to understand, solve, and implement each part. For instance, if you were building a software application, you might decompose it into modules or functions, each handling a specific aspect of the overall functionality. Decomposition facilitates collaboration as different team members can work on different parts simultaneously. -->
<!-- Algorithmic Thinking: -->

<!-- Definition: Algorithmic thinking involves designing and expressing solutions as a sequence of steps or instructions that can be followed to achieve a specific goal. -->
<!-- In Practice: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Algorithmic thinking is crucial in computer science because it helps in developing efficient and effective solutions. When solving a problem, one needs to think about the logical steps that lead from the input to the desired output. This can involve using conditional statements, loops, and other programming constructs to create a well-defined process. Developing algorithmic thinking skills enables a person to approach problem-solving systematically. -->
<!-- In summary, these principles collectively contribute to a structured and systematic approach to problem-solving in computer science. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, decomposition breaks down problems into manageable parts, and algorithmic thinking allows for the design and implementation of step-by-step solutions. These principles are not only fundamental to computer science but are also applicable in various fields where systematic problem-solving is required. -->

<!-- Identify the Inputs, Processes, and Outputs for a Problem: -->

<!-- Inputs: These are the data or information that a program receives from the user, sensors, or other sources. Inputs are the starting point for any computation. -->
<!-- Processes: Processes refer to the actions or calculations that are performed on the input data to produce some result. These are the steps the program takes to transform the inputs into the desired outputs. -->
<!-- Outputs: Outputs are the results or information produced by the program after processing the input. They represent the end result of the computation. -->
<!-- Structure Diagrams: -->

<!-- Definition: Structure diagrams are visual representations that show the organization and relationships between different parts of a program or system. They help in understanding the overall structure and flow of a solution. -->
<!-- In Practice: In a structure diagram, you might use shapes or boxes to represent different modules, functions, or components of a program, and lines or arrows to show how they are connected or interact with each other. It provides a high-level view of the program's structure. -->
<!-- Create, Interpret, Correct, Complete, and Refine Algorithms: -->

<!-- Pseudocode: Pseudocode is a way of expressing algorithms in a high-level, human-readable format. It's not tied to a specific programming language but helps in outlining the logical steps of a solution. -->
<!-- Flowcharts: Flowcharts are visual representations of algorithms using different shapes to represent actions, decisions, and loops. Arrows indicate the flow of control between these elements. -->
<!-- Reference Language/High-Level Programming Language: This involves writing the algorithm in a specific programming language. The language used depends on the student's familiarity with programming languages covered in their course. -->
<!-- Identify Common Errors: -->

<!-- Definition: Common errors refer to mistakes or issues that often occur in programming. Identifying and understanding these errors is crucial for writing reliable and error-free code. -->
<!-- Examples: Common errors include syntax errors (errors in the code structure), logic errors (flaws in the algorithm leading to incorrect results), and runtime errors (errors that occur during program execution). -->
<!-- Trace Tables: -->

<!-- Definition: Trace tables are used to manually trace the execution of a program, step by step. They help in understanding how the values of variables change as the program runs. -->
<!-- In Practice: Students use trace tables to track the values of variables at different points in the program, aiding in identifying errors or understanding the flow of control. -->
<!-- In summary, these concepts are fundamental for a student in GCSE Computer Science, providing tools and methodologies for problem-solving, algorithm design, and program analysis. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building a solid foundation in computer science. -->
