Legal Impacts and Risks:
Data Protection Laws:

GDPR and Similar Regulations: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and similar laws elsewhere have established rules for the handling of personal data, impacting how companies collect and process user information.
Cybersecurity Threats:

Data Breaches: The increase in cyberattacks and data breaches has led to legal consequences for organizations that fail to adequately protect sensitive information.
Intellectual Property Issues:

Digital Piracy: The ease of copying and distributing digital content has raised concerns about intellectual property rights and piracy.
Regulation of Emerging Technologies:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Systems: The legal framework around emerging technologies like AI and autonomous systems is still evolving, with questions about liability and accountability.


Computer use has brought new concerns and new crimes. With the rise of the internet, computers are increasingly being used for illegal activities.

Computers might be used unlawfully in many ways, for example:

allowing someone to illegally share personal 
data
helping to steal financial information, such as credit card numbers or bank account details
helping to illegally copy and distribute films, television programmes and music
extorting information or blackmailing someone
Legislation is needed to cover new technologies and protect the public.
